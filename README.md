# My Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio built using React, Vite, and Material UI (MUI). This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experience in Full stack development.

## Features

- **Modern UI** built with Material UI for a sleek and responsive design.
- **Fast Performance** thanks to Vite for lightning-fast development and build processes.
- **Responsive Layout** that adjusts seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Interactive Skills Section** with visually appealing icons and hover effects.
- **Project Showcase** displaying some of my key web development projects.
- **Contact Section** to get in touch with me.

## Tech Stack

- **React** â€“ A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** â€“ A next-generation, fast, and optimized build tool for React projects.
- **Material UI (MUI)** â€“ A popular React UI framework to design modern, consistent, and user-friendly components.
- **React Icons** â€“ For adding various icons throughout the portfolio.
- **CSS & Styled Components** â€“ For custom styling and layout.
- **React Router** (if used) â€“ For navigation between different sections of the portfolio.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riyavij2001/RiyaVij.git
   cd RiyaVij
   ```
2. Install npm dependencies:
    ```bash 
    npm install
     ```
3. Start the frontend server::

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will launch the Vite-powered React app on http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port).

```bash 
    This updated setup is now aligned with Vite, which uses `npm run dev` for development instead of `npm start`. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
```
